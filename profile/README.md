## Contributing/Building

The Honey Finance protocol is completely open source and transparant so the community can be involved while we build.

Honey Finance aims to teach individuals about DeFi and create an army of builders that onboard the next billion users into crypto.

Honey Finance incentivises people to build open source code for everyone to leverage.
